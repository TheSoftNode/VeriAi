🛠️ Tech requirements
Your project must demonstrably use one or more Flare Core Protocols:

Flare Data Connector (FDC) — Securely brings external blockchain or Web2 API data on-chain. Uses an attestation consensus model with Merkle proof verification. https://dev.flare.network/fdc/getting-started/
Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO) — Delivers decentralized price & time-series data to dApps without centralized providers. https://dev.flare.network/ftso/getting-started
FAssets (FXRP) — Trustless system for bringing XRP into Flare as FXRP for DeFi and cross-chain use. https://dev.flare.network/fassets/overview
Secure Random Number — Tamper-resistant randomness aggregated from all data providers. https://dev.flare.network/network/guides/secure-random-numbers
