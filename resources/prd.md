## **Product Requirements Document: VeriAI**

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft
**Author:** [Your Name/Team Name]
**Date:** October 26, 2023

### 1. Vision & Overview

**Product Name:** VeriAI
**Tagline:** On-Chain Verification for AI-Generated Content.
**Vision:** To become the standard for cryptographic provenance and tamper-proof verification of AI model outputs, bringing trust and accountability to the AI economy.

**Elevator Pitch:** VeriAI leverages the Flare Network's native Flare Data Connector (FDC) to fetch and attest to the outputs of Web2 AI APIs. It provides users with an immutable, on-chain certificate (NFT) that proves a specific AI output is genuine and has not been altered, solving critical issues of trust and authenticity in AI-generated content.

### 2. Problem Statement

The rapid adoption of generative AI models has led to two major problems:

1.  **Lack of Provenance:** It is impossible to cryptographically prove that a piece of content (text, image description, data analysis) was generated by a specific AI model from a specific prompt.
2.  **Susceptibility to Tampering:** AI outputs can be easily modified after generation, with no way to detect the alteration, leading to potential misinformation, fraud, and intellectual property disputes.

Current solutions are centralized and non-verifiable, creating a single point of failure and trust.

### 3. Solution & Value Proposition

VeriAI provides a decentralized verification layer for AI outputs by utilizing the Flare Blockchain.

1.  **Submit:** A user submits a prompt and selects an AI model via the VeriAI dApp.
2.  **Attest:** The Flare Data Connector (FDC) decentralized oracle network calls the same AI API, reaches consensus on the valid output, and submits the result with a cryptographic proof to the Flare blockchain.
3.  **Verify & Mint:** A smart contract on Flare verifies the FDC's proof. Upon successful verification, it mints a VeriAI NFT to the user's address.
4.  **Prove:** The VeriAI NFT serves as an immutable certificate of authenticity, allowing anyone to verify the integrity and origin of the AI-generated content.

**Value Proposition:**

- **For Users:** Prove the authenticity of your AI-generated content for portfolios, legal evidence, or academic work.
- **For Developers:** Integrate VeriAI's verification into your dApps to build trustless AI-powered applications.
- **For Enterprises:** Create a tamper-proof audit trail for AI-generated business intelligence, reports, and automated processes.

### 4. Scope & Limitations (Hackathon MVP)

**In Scope for MVP:**

- Support for text-based AI models (e.g., a mock API or a single model like GPT-3.5-turbo).
- Minting a non-transferable "Soulbound" NFT (SBT) upon successful verification.
- A simple web interface to submit prompts and view verification results/NFTs.
- Entire system functioning on Flare's **Coston2 testnet**.
- Using the **Flare Data Connector (FDC)** for one specific, hardcoded API endpoint.

**Out of Scope for MVP:**

- Support for image generation models (Stable Diffusion, DALL-E).
- A complex marketplace or gallery for NFTs.
- Advanced features like sharing permissions, revoking verification, or custom NFT metadata.
- Mainnet deployment.

### 5. User Stories & Flow

**As a User, I want to:**

- Connect my Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the VeriAI dApp.
- Input a text prompt and select an AI model to generate a response.
- Pay a small gas fee (in testnet C2FLR) to initiate the verification process.
- See a status update while the FDC network attests to the result.
- Receive a VeriAI NFT in my wallet upon successful verification.
- View my collection of VeriAI NFTs and see the prompt, output, and verification details for each.

**User Flow:**

1.  User lands on `app.veri-ai.io`.
2.  User connects their Flare-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask configured for Coston2).
3.  User enters a prompt (e.g., "Explain the FDC in simple terms") and clicks "Generate & Verify".
4.  The UI shows a loading state: "Generating AI response...".
5.  The UI updates: "Requesting decentralized attestation from Flare Data Connector...".
6.  The UI updates: "Verifying attestation on Flare Blockchain...".
7.  Upon success, the UI shows: "Verification Complete!" and displays the AI output. A new VeriAI NFT appears in the user's "My Collection" section.
8.  If the FDC verification fails, the UI displays an error: "Verification Failed. The output could not be independently attested."

    style C fill:#f3e5f5
```

**Components:**

1.  **Frontend (React/Next.js):** Provides the UI for user interaction. Uses `wagmi.sh` or `etherspot` for wallet connection. hosted on Vercel/Netlify.
2.  **Backend (Node.js Serverless Function):** Handles communication with the external AI API. This is necessary to hide API keys. It receives the prompt from the frontend, calls the AI API, and returns the output. _For the hackathon, this can be mocked to avoid API costs._
3.  **Smart Contract (Solidity):** The core logic. Key functions:
    - `function requestVerification(string memory prompt, string memory model) external payable`: Initiates the process. Emits an event that (in a full implementation) could be read by an off-chain relayer to trigger the FDC.
    - `function fulfillVerification(bytes32 requestId, string memory output, bytes memory proof) external`: Called by the FDC (or a relayer) with the consensus data and proof. The contract verifies the proof using Flare's `MerkleProof` library.
    - `function mintVeriAI NFT(address to, string memory prompt, string memory output) private`: Mints the NFT upon successful proof verification.
4.  **Flare Data Connector (FDC):** The decentralized oracle network. It will be configured to call the same AI API endpoint as our backend. The FDC providers will consensus on the result and submit it to our contract.

### 7. Key Technical Requirements & Dependencies

- **Blockchain:** Flare Coston2 Testnet (Chain ID 114).
- **Core Protocol:** **Flare Data Connector (FDC)**. This is the non-negotiable, central component.
- **Smart Contract Development:** Flare Hardhat Starter Kit.
- **FDC Interaction:** Use the `@flare-foundation/periphery` NPM package for proof verification.
- **Frontend:** React, `wagmi.sh`, `viem`, `@apollo/client` (for querying the blockchain).
- **Wallet Connection:** MetaMask (configured for Coston2).
- **NFT Standard:** Possibly a simple SBT standard to prevent transfer.

### 8. Success Metrics (How We Demo)

The demo video will prove success by demonstrating:

1.  **E2E Functionality:** A complete, successful flow from prompt to verified NFT in under 2 minutes.
2.  **Trustlessness:** Showing that the result is not just coming from our backend but is verified by Flare's decentralized network.
3.  **Tamper Evidence:** Explaining how changing a single character in the output would cause the FDC proof verification to fail, thus protecting the integrity of the certificate.
4.  **On-Chain Proof:** Showing the successful transaction and the minted NFT on the Coston2 Flarescan explorer.

### 9. Open Questions & Risks

- **Q:** What is the exact latency of the FDC attestation process?
  - **Risk:** The process may be too slow for a live demo. **Mitigation:** Have a pre-verified example ready to show instantly, and explain the live process separately.
- **Q:** How do we trigger the FDC network from our smart contract?
  - **Risk:** The FDC initiation flow might be complex. **Mitigation:** For the hackathon, a simplified, more centralized approach where our backend triggers the FDC process might be acceptable, as long as the _on-chain verification_ of the decentralized proof is the star of the show.
- **Q:** Cost of AI API calls?
  - **Mitigation:** Use a mock API or a very limited number of requests for the demo.
